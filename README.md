# Robot Pathfinding Simulation

This project simulates a robot exploring an unknown terrain using Monte Carlo exploration and Q-learning algorithms. The robot learns the optimal path by navigating the environment and updating a Q-matrix based on rewards from different actions. The epsilon-greedy policy balances exploration and exploitation to help the robot reach the goal efficiently.

## Features

- **Monte Carlo Exploration**: Random exploration of the environment to find potential paths.
- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: Learning from rewards to optimize the path to the goal.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy**: Balancing between exploration and exploitation to find the best path.

## Requirements

This project does not require any external Python libraries; it only uses the Python standard library.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
